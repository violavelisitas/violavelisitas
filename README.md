## Hi! 👋

I'm **Viola Velisitas Davina** 👩‍🎓  
An **Information Systems student** who is currently building a strong foundation in technology, data, and collaborative software development

I value integrity when working with data and believe that understanding *why* something happens is more important than rushing to conclusions. I prefer learning at a steady pace, focusing on depth, clarity, and long-term growth rather than short-term results.

I naturally approach problems with a reflective and analytical mindset. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas, questioning patterns, and revisiting decisions to gain better understanding. Consistency, logical reasoning, and honesty with data are principles I try to hold throughout my learning journey.

Going forward, I aim to grow into a role in the **data or analytics field**, where careful thinking, research, and data-driven decision-making are genuinely valued.
